# AI-Summer-of-Code-Semantic-Layer-Session

This project is solely for the purpose of the AI summer of Code Bootcamp. To follow through the live session, you will need to do some setup before the session date. 

Please follow the instructions below to do the setup:

## Fork the repository

This is important to link it to your dbt cloud account.

## Setup a Snowflake Account

Snowflake is the data warehouse we will be using in this case to build the semantic layer on.

Create a 30-day trial Snowflake account via this [link](https://signup.snowflake.com/)

## Setup dbt Cloud

Setting up a dbt Cloud account for the first time gives you a 14-day trial. If you had a dbt Cloud account before, you will need to still create a new one because you need a trial account or enterprise account to use the dbt semantic layer.

You can create an account via this [link](https://www.getdbt.com/signup)

## Setup a Dot Account

Dot will be the frontend interface that we will be using to access our semantic layer. It already has a Large Language Model built in it. 

You can set up the account [here](https://www.getdot.ai/)

## Conclusion

Now that you have setup all these. You are prepared for the live session we will be having where I will show you how to setup a semantic layer in dbt cloud and interact with it using Dot.
